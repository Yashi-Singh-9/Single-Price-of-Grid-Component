## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on building a responsive grid component. Key learnings include:

- Implementing Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive layouts.
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent styling across different elements.
- Adding hover states to interactive elements like buttons.

Example CSS snippet for button hover effect:

```css
button:hover {
    background-color: hsl(71, 73%, 64%);
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced CSS Grid features and JavaScript for interactive components. Additionally, refining my understanding of responsive design principles and accessibility best practices is a priority.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Great resource for understanding Flexbox.
- [MDN Web Docs on CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Useful for mastering CSS Grid.
